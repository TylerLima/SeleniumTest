# SeleniumTest
Python based program using Selenium interacts with survey website 

Purpose:
This program navigates to a specific website and votes for a particular group using a checkbox to select the
group you want to win. The website allows multiple votes from the same user, making several submissions possible.

Note: This project was inspired by a survey I was asked to help build. Due to personal morals I did not use this
program to allow my friends to win the survey. I did use the survey as a tester to see if my program does work properly.
